Advanced Customization
======================

Overview
--------

Advanced customization features in ChatLab let you move beyond basic model
configuration — allowing you to **shape the identity, behavior, and ethical
boundaries** of your bots. These settings define not just *what* your bots
say, but *how* they express themselves and interact with participants.

Through personas, avatars, and moderation controls, researchers can create
distinctive conversational agents while ensuring participant safety and
regulatory compliance.

Why It Matters
--------------

Customizing these features allows ChatLab to serve a wide range of research
contexts:

- Simulate different conversational styles (e.g., empathetic, formal, casual)
- Align the bot's visual appearance with study themes or demographics
- Protect participants from unsafe or sensitive content
- Maintain ethical and IRB-aligned communication standards

Components
----------

Advanced customization in ChatLab is divided into three key components:

1. **Personas** — Define the bot's tone, perspective, and conversational
   style using a structured prompt template. Personas let you simulate
   a “personality” that fits your study design or participant condition.

2. **Avatars** — Assign static or dynamically generated visual identities
   to bots or participants. Avatars create a sense of presence and can
   be used to explore visual framing effects in AI-human interactions.

3. **Moderation** — Configure content safety filters and category thresholds
   to automatically detect and block harmful or inappropriate messages.
   Moderation settings help ensure compliance with ethical standards.

Example Use Cases
-----------------

- Designing multiple bots with distinct personalities for comparison studies.
- Adding visual avatars to test user engagement or perception differences.
- Enforcing moderation for vulnerable or general-audience studies.
- Creating realistic, controlled human-like simulations within research surveys.
