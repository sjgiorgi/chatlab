Conversation Design
===================

ChatLab bots are driven by carefully designed prompts and initial messages.

Prompts
-------

Each bot begins with a **system prompt** defining its goals, tone, and constraints.
For example:

.. code-block:: text

   You are a friendly study assistant who helps participants reflect on daily stress.

Initial Messages
----------------

- Define the bot's first message to participants.
- Set up a natural start for conversation.
- Avoid overly robotic phrasing; participants should feel like they're speaking with a person.
