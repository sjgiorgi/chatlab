Behavioral Parameters
=====================

These settings control ChatLab's **humanlike timing and delivery style**.

Delays
------

- **Reading speed:** how quickly the bot reads participant input (WPM)
- **Writing speed:** how quickly the bot composes responses (WPM)
- **Jitter:** random timing variation for realism
- **Thinking time:** extra delay before responding

Message Chunking
----------------

Bots can send messages in **chunks**, simulating typing bubbles or SMS-like pacing.

Context Window
--------------

Define how many past turns to include in each model prompt. A shorter history
reduces API cost; a longer one improves contextual understanding.
