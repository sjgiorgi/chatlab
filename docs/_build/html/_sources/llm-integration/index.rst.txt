LLM Integration
===============

ChatLab supports multiple large language model (LLM) providers and APIs.  
These settings determine which model powers your bot, how it's accessed, and
how API credentials are stored securely in the system.

Typical setup includes selecting a model provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, or
Amazon Bedrock) and configuring the appropriate API key.
