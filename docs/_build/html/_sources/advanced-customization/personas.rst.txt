Personas
========

Personas define *who* the bot is — their style, tone, and perspective.

Creating Personas
-----------------

In the ChatLab admin panel:

1. Go to **Personas → Add Persona**
2. Provide:
   - **Name:** internal identifier (e.g., "Friendly Assistant")
   - **Instructions:** descriptive traits and goals

Example persona prompt:

.. code-block:: text

   You are a supportive college advisor who uses casual, encouraging language.

Assigning Personas
------------------

Each bot can be linked to one persona. This sets the default prompt and tone
for all conversations associated with that bot.

Managing Variability
--------------------

You can create multiple personas and randomly assign them to participants to
test conversational style effects.
