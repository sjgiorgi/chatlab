======================

Design how ChatLab bots communicate â€” their tone, pacing, and timing.  
These features shape the realism of each conversation, making interactions
feel more natural and engaging to participants.

Typical setup includes designing the bot's prompt and configuring behavioral
parameters that control delay, typing speed, and message chunking.
