ChatLab ‚Äî Embedding Human‚ÄìAI Conversations in Research Studies
==============================================================

*An open-source backend for integrating LLM-driven chat experiences into surveys and crowdsourced studies*

Overview
--------

**ChatLab** allows researchers to embed large language model (LLM) conversations
directly inside survey platforms such as **Qualtrics** and **REDCap**, which can
then be deployed via **Prolific** or **MTurk** for participant recruitment.

Participants never access ChatLab directly. Instead, ChatLab runs on AWS and
serves a secure web interface that is loaded as an **iframe within surveys**.
All conversations and metadata are stored automatically for later analysis.

Workflow Summary
----------------

1. **Deploy ChatLab** on AWS (Dockerized backend and React frontend)  
2. **Embed ChatLab** within Qualtrics or REDCap using an iframe  
3. **Run surveys** through Prolific or MTurk for recruitment  
4. **Collect and export conversation data** for analysis  

Key Features
------------

- üîó **Survey Integration:** Embed bots inside Qualtrics or REDCap  
- ü§ù **Crowdworking Integration:** Manage participants via Prolific or MTurk  
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Bot Configuration:** Define prompts, personas, models, and delays  
- üìä **Data Collection:** Automatically capture conversation metadata  
- üß† **Analysis Tools:** Export to DLATK, ConvoKit, or R's `text` for linguistic research  
- üöÄ **AWS Deployment:** Fully containerized, secure cloud hosting
